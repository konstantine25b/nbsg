                    The present research and invention addresses the need of new type of lightweight, compact, simple to use, adjustable, wearable and effective method using device (Suit, glove or gadget) for accelerating rehabilitation process and enhancing existing physical therapy/training and virtual reality technologies. The way we accomplish our goal is an implementation of smart materials - SMAs (Shape Memory Alloys) [7] such as Nitinol in a specially engineered way. Nickel titanium, also known as Nitinol [8], is a metal alloy of nickel and titanium, where the two elements are present in roughly equal atomic percentages. Nitinol alloys exhibit two unique properties: the shape memory effect and superelasticity (also called pseudoelasticity). Shape memory is the ability of nitinol to undergo deformation at one temperature, stay in its deformed shape when the external force is removed, then recover its original, undeformed shape upon heating above its "transformation temperature". Superelasticity is the ability for the metal to undergo large deformations and immediately return to its undeformed shape upon removal of the external load. Nitinol can deform 10–30 times as much as ordinary metals and return to its original shape. Nitinol is one of the most common SMA materials, which is commercially available. This material raise big interest among scientists, because of it has so called “free energy” principle [9], when it is able to produce all type of mechanical motion just by temperature raising. However, inability of this material to be used constantly, since it suffers from functional fatigue after non-stop heating (forgetting the remembered shape), and less controllability because of long hysteresis (Period between the second usage), low heat temperatures exhibiting insufficient/slow power and mostly unpredictable behavior during shape memory recovery [10]. 
  The presented research and invention focus on solving this challenges or simply avoiding them by adjusting our designed gadgets to the targeted sphere problem in the way that the most of the Nitinol disadvantages can be easily ignored. For example, the functional fatigue (FF) and long hysteresis (H) are automatically solved just by the way we use Nitinol in the physical rehabilitation and Fitness. Nitinol mechanics are working constantly just a few minutes during little sessions, whose are followed with resting time, as usual during normal training, so nitinol is protected from constant overheating (minus FF) and we programmatically set the resting time for each power level in the way that it will be enough for nitinol to cool down(minus H). Consequently, only remaining 2-3 challenges left to solve for what we designed new innovational structure for SMA muscle “Tensioned NITI muscle(TNM)” consisting of diverse of NITI wires such as NiTiCu or NiTiAl with possibility to be combined with other types of SMA materials(such as iron or copper SMAs[11]) and using divergent diameter wires instead of  alike ones. This structure supposed to provide the device with faster reaction, using speed by heat transfer among them through mechanical connection. Consequently, thicker and more powerful, but slow wires can be combined with fast heat able, but low power generating thin wires, such as, 0.15mm diameter NITI, which is repeatedly usable every 2 seconds, but can lift just 330g in original SMA bundle design [12] with 48 0.15mm diameter wire, when 12 0.3mm wire bundle is capable to lift up 1250g every 8 second time interval (FIG 8A). After the combining - we can found the ultimate combination in terms of stiffness, speed, power and controllability. We understand that our tension designed and diversified memory muscle includes some disadvantages such as worse cooling ability and difficulties with electric power supply regulations since Nitinol is heated by electricity through its resistance and such a complex design may cause flowing less current among some wires. However, the cooling problem can be mostly covered the same as we exclude long hysteresis and since there are plenty of other mechanical ways for system cool down.  As for power supplying, we consider that after discovering above-mentioned ultimate combination the powering state is less problematic, since very thin Nitinols require high voltage and even in the case when there is inability to use compact batteries, device can be using power from ordinary 220-volt home plug.

                    Our invention will have huge impact firstly in the medical sphere, specifically, in the physical rehabilitation - A process to restore physical abilities lost to injury or disease in order to function in a normal or near-normal way. Nowadays, the average physical care centers see between 101 and 200 patients each week that equates to over 300 million therapy sessions each year [1]. One of the main challenges, which patients face during rehabilitation, is the beginning process, when they need to do some movements after recent injury or disease that requires a lot of effort and causes tremendous pain. Since the process of rehabilitation should start as early as possible after an injury and form a continuum with other therapeutic interventions. It can also start before or immediately after surgery when an injury requires a surgical intervention. Moreover, the physical rehabilitation consists of six main challenges [2]: 1. Safety; 2. Economic stability; 3. Acceleration of Recovery; 4.  Differentiation; 5. Personalization (of treatment); 6. Improvement of your patients; (bonus track) sensorimotor focus of the wrist. These are challenges whose salvation leads to the major goal of rehabilitation - FUNCTION: to maximize the function or abilities of an individual, in spite of existing or developing impairments, and to do this in the least intrusive way possible (in a way that is most enjoyable, with least cost, time and effort expended, and least burden to the person and family).
                     <br> In terms of physical rehabilitation, the most frequently described components of the seven main themes were peers, advice, physical exercise, assistive technology and home adaptations, and personal responsibility. Moreover, our research and invention is concentrated around making new assistive technology - wearable smart glove or suit, which will significantly increase the acceleration of recovery, especially, at the start of exercises. Furthermore, it will be adjusting for each patient that will foster personalization of treatment and be suitable for differentiation.

                    Secondly, the next targeted field of our invention is physical therapy and whole Fitness sphere, also defined by experts as “one's ability to execute daily activities with optimal performance, endurance, and strength with the management of disease, fatigue, and stress and reduced sedentary behavior.”[3] The importance of physical Fitness is undeniable since it promotes strong muscles/bones and improves respiratory, cardiovascular and overall health. However, not everyone is able to go to gym or have access to training equipment, which are the reasons why only one in three children are physically active every day(66.6% physical inactivity among children)[4]. Especially, during pandemic when all Fitness centers got closed and the whole world lost opportunity for gaining effective exercises, the statistics gone through the rapid change from the national average ≈65% to ≈44% worldwide who were able to handle the new factors caused by pandemic. In addition, that is why during- and in post-COVID period everyone started looking for the comfortable ways or gadgets for effective training in home area.
                    <br> 
                    In Fitness, a plethora of research indicates the importance of all four types of Fitness exercise:  endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility. The most of training machines for the mentioned exercises are huge and have a lack of comfortability or mobility. That is why we concentrated on making not only the wearable glove or body suit, which will act as a miniature and mobile training machine with every user adaptive technology/system, but also as compact gadgets for training specified muscles with detailed power/force regulation ability.

                    The last but not least important industry where our invention will have significant influence is Virtual Reality (VR). Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment (particularly video games), education (such as medical or military training) and business (such as virtual meetings) [5]. Other distinct types of VR-style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality, sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR. Right now the most of existing technology consists of VR headsets, joysticks, vibrating gloves and suits, however everyone are still trying to develop new technology which will make us able to better dive into artificial reality by enabling to feel or touch something in virtual world, since the current technologies are not capable yet to do this task or are over complicated for usage.
                    <br>
                    With Development of VR, the gadgets are getting more detailed, smaller and easy-to-use, however, they are still concentrated around just two human senses - sight/vision and hearing, and not on sense of touches. And our solution to the VR technologies is upgrading and making new compact, simple working mechanics VR-glove and full-body suit, which unlike the existing products will give a user opportunity to feel virtual reality, making unavailable to go through virtual objects and would not be as complex as recent invention - Haptex  glove [6].
